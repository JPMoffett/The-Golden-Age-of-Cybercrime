The Golden Age of Piracy emerged from a perfect storm of skilled but unemployed sailors, weakened empires, and rapidly changing trade networks. 
Today’s tech world mirrors that turbulence in striking ways. Just as displaced seafarers turned their expertise toward opportunistic, 
decentralized ventures on the open sea, waves of laid-off engineers and security specialists now navigate a landscape of fragmented platforms, 
shifting corporate priorities, and expanding digital frontiers, having been replaced by cheap, unskilled labor whose ineffectiveness is eroding our infrastructure.
Meanwhile, the merchant ships of our era (massive data stores, cloud infrastructure, and AI-driven systems) carry immense value yet remain unevenly defended, 
creating incentives for both innovation and exploitation to cybercriminals now unbound by the restraints of a well-maintained system. 
In both ages, volatility and expertise collide to produce new forms of power, resistance, and opportunity in the spaces traditional authorities struggle to control; 
eventually ending in a massive increase in governance by the powers that be.
A Golden Age of Cybercrime is nearing.
